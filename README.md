# General Formal Ontology (light version)

[![Test consistency](https://github.com/Onto-Med/gfo-light/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Onto-Med/gfo-light/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/927218818.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14833002)

## Introduction

GFO-light contains some simplifications compared to the full version of General Formal Ontology (GFO, [Loebe, F. et al. (2022). GFO: The General Formal Ontology.](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-220264)) and is designed as a framework for the efficient development and foundation of domain/application ontologies. GFO-light is primarily concerned with categories of concrete individuals (continuants, processes, attributives, and situations), i.e., entities that have an immediate relation to time or to space-time.

## How to Use

You just need to import this ontology into your domain-specific ontology via the IRI https://w3id.org/gfo-light. For each [release](https://github.com/Onto-Med/gfo-light/releases) of this ontology, a version IRI is available with the format `https://w3id.org/gfo-light/release/<VERSION>`. In addition, the version IRI <https://w3id.org/gfo-light/release/latest> always represents the latest version.

When developing a domain-specific ontology using GFO-light, please create your classes as subclasses of _Continuant_, _Attributive_, _Process_, _Situation_, and _TimeEntity_ (or their subclasses, the more specific the better). You can also create the desired object or data properties (if possible as subproperties of GFO-light properties).

For more information, see the [ontology documentation](https://onto-med.github.io/gfo-light/latest/) and our [user guide](docs/README.md).

Individual IRIs of GFO-light classes and properties (e.g., https://w3id.org/gfo-light/Category) are pointing to the RDF browser [RickView](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/rickview).

## Examples

Here is a selection of ontologies we maintain that are founded in GFO-light and can serve as a starting point for working with GFO-light.
