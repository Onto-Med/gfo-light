# GFO-light: General Formal Ontology (light version)

GFO-light contains some simplifications compared to the full version of General Formal Ontology (GFO, [Loebe, F. et al. (2022). GFO: The General Formal Ontology.](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-220264)) and is designed as a framework for the efficient development and foundation of domain/application ontologies. This guide describes the structure and a possible use of this lightweight top-level ontology in domain-specific projects, also for users who are not familiar with the basics of formal ontologies. GFO-light is primarily concerned with categories of concrete individuals ([continuant](#continuant), [process](#process), [attributive](#attributive) and [situation](#situation)), i.e., entities that have an immediate relation to time ([time entity](#time-entity)) or to space-time.

⚠ When developing a domain-specific ontology using GFO-light, please create your classes as subclasses of *Continuant*, *Attributive*, *Process*, *Situation* and *TimeEntity* (or their subclasses, the more specific the better). You can also create the desired object or data properties (if possible as subproperties of GFO-light properties).

## Continuant

Material three-dimensional objects, their groups/aggregates and parts as well as immaterial two-, one- and zero-dimensional entities (i.e., surfaces, lines and points) are subsumed under the category *Continuant*. Continuants are concrete individuals that persist through time and are wholly present at every point of their existence time (lifetime). 

**Material continuants** subsume the following:

* individual 3-dimensional material objects (e.g., a person, a computer, a chopstick or a football stadium)
* material aggregates (groups) of objects that together form a unit (e.g., a research group at a university or a sports team)
* material parts that have no natural boundary with the whole material object (e.g., part of a bone or of a chopstick)

<table>

    <tr><td>Team</td><td>MaterialAggregate</td><td><i>hasMember some Player</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Player</td><td>MaterialObject</td><td><i>memberOf exactly 1 Team</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stadium</td><td>MaterialObject</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>FootballFieldSurface</td><td>Surface</td><td><i>hasOwner exactly 1 Stadium</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>FootballFieldBoundaryLine</td><td>Line</td><td><i>boundaryOf exactly 1 FootballFieldSurface</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 1a.** *Continuant classes.*

Usually, connected objects are considered as single material objects, i.e., the object parts are firmly connected to the whole object, while loose objects can form a group/aggregate. When modelling a person, for example, you could consider their skeleton as a (connected) material object and as part of the human body. However, if we look at bone finds in the context of anthropology, the skeleton can be modelled as an aggregate of individual bones.

The object parts can be specified using the object properties *hasPart* or *partOf*. To model the membership of a member in a group/aggregate, the more specific object properties *hasMember*/*memberOf* should be used (Example 1b, playerA1). Material objects can be located in other material objects (*locatedIn*, e.g., the driver is located in the car).

**Immaterial continuants** are 0-, 1-, or 2-dimensional immaterial (visible or imaginary) entities (i.e., points, lines and surfaces) that are located on material continuants or in them. In the anthropology use case, for example, these can be certain planes (e.g., frontal plane), axes (e.g., longitudinal axis) and points (e.g., gonion) of the human skeleton. Other examples are the surface and the boundary lines of the football field or the penalty spot. Immaterial continuants can border material continuants (natural boundaries) or be located inside them (inner boundaries). Such relationships are specified using object properties *boundaryOf*, *innerBoundaryOf* or *naturalBoundaryOf*. Boundaries of material objects are surfaces, boundaries of surfaces are lines and boundaries of lines are points. Lines are not necessarily straight. They can be, for example, curves or broken lines that pass through (*spatiallyPassesThrough*, *spatiallyStartsOn*, *spatiallyEndsOn*) various points and form a corner, a triangle or a polygon. Immaterial continuants can be assigned to a corresponding material continuant using the object property *hasOwner*.

⚠ In contrast to GFO (full) (see [Loebe, F. et al. (2022). GFO: The General Formal Ontology.](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-220264)), GFO-light does not support presentic objects (presentials) but only temporally extended objects (continuats). However, GFO-light enables you to define the validity/existence time of attributives of the objects and situations in which they participate, either as a time interval or as a point in time.

⚠ GFO (full) includes a sophisticated space module based on the dual nature of space (phenomenal vs. extensional space) and distinguishes between boundaries of material objects and boundaries of spatial regions (see [Baumann, R. et al. (2016). Towards an Ontology of Space for GFO.](https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-660-6-53), [Loebe, F. et al. (2021). Developing GFO 2.0 Further – Initiating the Modules of Space and Material Objects.](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2969/paper69-FOUST.pdf)). For simplicity, GFO-light only considers boundaries of material objects.

## Process

Processes are concrete individuals that happen in time and have a temporal extension (chronoid/time interval). Processes represent dynamic knowledge. A football match, a treatment of a patient in a hospital or the course of an illness are examples of processes.  

<table>
    <tr><th>Domain class</th><th>GFO-light superclass</th><th>Restriction</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Match</td><td>Process</td><td><i>locatedIn exactly 1 Stadium</br>
											 hasProcessPart exactly 1 FirstHalf</br>
											 hasProcessPart exactly 1 SecondHalf</br>
											 hasParticipant exactly 2 Team</br>
											 temporallyStartedBy exactly 1 StartOfMatch</br>
											 temporallyFinishedBy exactly 1 EndOfMatch</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>FirstHalf</td><td>Process</td><td><i>processPartOf exactly 1 Match</br>
												 temporallyStartedBy exactly 1 StartOfMatch</br>
												 temporallyFinishedBy exactly 1 EndOfFirstHalf</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>SecondHalf</td><td>Process</td><td><i>processPartOf exactly 1 Match</br>
												  temporallyStartedBy exactly 1 StartOfSecondHalf</br>
												  temporallyFinishedBy exactly 1 EndOfMatch</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 2a.** *Process classes.*

Processes can have parts (*hasProcessPart*, *processPartOf*), which are situations, attributives or further processes, e.g., the first half and the goal situations are parts of the match. Continuants can participate in processes (*participatesIn*, *hasParticipant*), e.g., the teams A and B participate in the football match (Example 1b, teamA). Processes can take place (*locatedIn*) in material objects (e.g., a football match in a stadium or an illness in a person). Processes can lead to (*leadsTo*, *resultsFrom*) or cause (*causes*, *causedBy*) further processes and situations.

    <tr><th>Instance</th><th>Type</th><th>Assertion</th></tr>

    <tr><td>half1</td><td>FirstHalf</td><td><i>processPartOf matchX</br>
											   temporallyStartedBy startOfMatch</br>
											   temporallyFinishedBy endOfFirstHalf</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 2b.** *Process instances.*

## Attributive

Qualities (attributes, traits, characteristics, etc.) of concrete individuals, relations (relators) between them and roles that objects can play in different contexts are subsumed under the category *Attributive*. Attributives are individuals that depend on other individuals by some kind of dependency relation.

### Quality

Qualities are attributives that typically inhere in its bearer and can possess values. Examples are observable or measurable characteristics of single objects, e.g., persons, (such as weight and height, laboratory parameters or symptoms), qualities of object groups (e.g., goals scored by a football team in a match) or of processes (e.g., the number of spectators as quality of a football match). The qualities can be defined in two ways. If they have a value (representable as a number, string, date, etc.), do not require the specification of existence time and are no parts of situations, domain-specific data properties can simply be defined as subproperties of *decimalValue* (e.g., *numberOfSpectators*), *stringValue*, *dateTimeValue*, etc. These domain-specific properties can then be used in data property assertions for a direct assignment of the value to the corresponding bearer (Example 2b, matchX). In all other cases, a separate domain-specific class (e.g., *PlayerGoals*) must be created as a subclass of *Quality* and its instances can be assigned to the bearers using the object properties *qualityOf* or *hasQuality*. In this case, the existence time can be specified for the quality instances (Example 3b, a1GoalsEndOfFirstHalf, a1GoalsEndOfMatch).

<table>
    <tr><th>Domain class</th><th>GFO-light superclass</th><th>Restriction</th></tr>
    <tr><td>PlayerQuality</br>

**Example 3a.** *Attributive classes.*

### Role

A role is a relational entity that links a continuant (role player) with some context, in which the continuant plays that role. We distinguish between continuant part roles, processual roles, situational roles and relational roles. A **continuant part role** is the role that a continuant part plays in the whole continuant (e.g., the processor is part of the computer and has the task/function/role to process commands or John is part/member of the football team and plays the role of midfielder, Example 3b, a2RoleImTeam). A **processual role** is the role that a participant plays in a process (e.g., team A plays the home team role and team B plays the visiting team role in a football match, Example 3b, teamARole). A **situational role** is the role that a participant plays in a situation (e.g., scorer and assistant role in a goal situation or roles played by a doctor and a patient in a risk/adverse situation in hospital). A **relational role** is the role that an entity plays in a relation (relator, see the next paragraph). Roles are assigned to the corresponding **context entity** (continuant, process, situation, relator) using object properties *roleIn* or *containsRole*. The role players are associated with the roles they play using object properties *plays* or *playedBy*.

    <tr><td>aWinnerRole</td><td>WinnerRole</td><td><i>roleIn winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch</br>
													  playedBy teamA</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 3b.** *Attributive instances. a1GoalsEndOfFirstHalf represents the number of goals of playerA1 in the time period between his first and second goal. a1GoalsEndOfMatch is the number of goals of playerA1 after the second goal. a2RoleImTeam is a midfielder (continuant part) role in teamA that is played by playerA2 (this role has an end time due to substitution). teamARole is the home team (processual) role in matchX that is played by teamA. aWinnerRole is the winner (relational) role in winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch that is also played by teamA.*

⚠ GFO-light uses a simplified role model compared to GFO (full). In GFO (full) there are three types of roles (see [Loebe, F. et al. (2022). GFO: The General Formal Ontology.](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-220264), [Loebe, F. (2007). Abstract vs. social roles: Towards a general theoretical account of roles.](https://doi.org/10.3233/APO-2007-031)): relational role as sibling of quality and subclass of attributive, processual role as subclass of process, and social role as social/socio continuant. However, all 4 GFO-light role types are considered as subclasses of role, and role as a subclass of attributive.

### Relator

Relators are attributives that connect other entities (role players) by relational roles (played by role players), i.e., represent individual relation instances. For example, a relator could be defined that describes the relative location of an object (playing the target object role) in relation to another object (playing the reference object role), e.g., the location of a person relative to the city centre or the location of an anatomical structure relative to the longitudinal axis. Such relators can be further classified, e.g., according to direction (in anthropology/anatomy, e.g., dorsal, ventral or lateral). Other examples are the marriage (relator) of John and Mary (in which Mary plays the wife role and John the husband role) or the winner-loser relator (Example 3b, winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch, aWinnerRole).

Similar to qualities, relations can also be represented by simple object properties (such as *hasPart*). However, if the existence time of the relation is relevant or it (or its roles) are parts of some situations, a relator (e.g., with a part and a whole role) should be used instead. An existence time can be defined both for relators themselves and for the individual roles (Example 3b, winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch, a2RoleImTeam). 

If the individual roles (regardless of the type, i.e., continuant part roles, processual roles, situational roles or relational roles) do not have an existence time to be defined and are no parts of situations or processes, they can likewise be represented by object properties. The relative position relator (see above) can, for example, be linked directly to the corresponding objects using the object properties *hasTargetObject* and *hasReferenceObject*. Similarly, football players can be assigned directly to a team using the properties *forwardOf*, *defenderOf*, etc. It also works with processual roles, the two playing teams can be associated to the football match by properties *homeTeamOf* and *visitingTeamOf*.

## Situation

Situations are combinations/constellations of attributives that belong together in the context of the use case under consideration. Situations represent static knowledge. A situation can exist at a certain point in time or during a certain period of time and can be part or result of a process or another situation (e.g., a goal situation as a result of an attack in a football match). Situations can lead to (*leadsTo*, *resultsFrom*) or cause (*causes*, *causedBy*) further situations and processes.

<table>
    <tr><th>Domain class</th><th>GFO-light superclass</th><th>Restriction</th></tr>
    <tr><td>MatchSituation</td><td>Situation</td><td><i>hasSituationPart some (MatchSituation or PlayerQuality or PlayerRoleInTeam or TeamQuality or TeamRoleInMatch or TeamRoleInWinnerLoserRelator or WinnerLoserRelator)</br>
														processPartOf exactly 1 Match</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 4a.** *Situation class.*

At the end of a football match (process), for example, a situation may arise in which one team has scored two goals and the other team one (the number of goals is a team's quality). A winner-loser relator can also be seen as part of this situation, with one team playing the winner role and the other team playing the loser role. Another example is a risk situation when treating a patient in hospital if his laboratory values (qualities) are in the critical range over a certain period of time. The desired attributives can be assigned to a situation using object properties *situationPartOf* or *hasSituationPart*. Continuants can participate in situations (*participatesIn*, *hasParticipant*), e.g., the player A1 participates in a goal situation or the teams participate in the situation at the end of the match.

<table>
    <tr><th>Instance</th><th>Type</th><th>Assertion</th></tr>
    <tr><td>situationEndOfMatch</td><td>MatchSituation</td><td><i>hasSituationPart winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch</br>

																  hasSituationPart a22RoleImTeam</br>
																  hasSituationPart a33RoleImTeam</br>
																  hasTime endOfMatch</br>
																  processPartOf matchX</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 4b.** *Situation instance. The situation at the end of the match contains all relevant attributives: winner-loser relator, teams’ qualities (aGoalsEndOfMatch, aBallPossessionEndOfMatch), teams’ processual roles in match (teamARole, teamBRole), players’ qualities (a1GoalsEndOfMatch, a2AssistsEndOfMatch), players’ continuant part roles in team (a1RoleImTeam, a22RoleImTeam, a33RoleImTeam).*

⚠ In GFO (full), both static and dynamic situations (object situations, presentic situations and situoids) are considered (see [Loebe, F. et al. (2022). GFO: The General Formal Ontology.](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-220264), [Burek, P. (2024). Ontologically Founded Design Patterns for Situation Modeling.](https://doi.org/10.62036/ISD.2024.85)). GFO-light does not distinguish between different situation types. To make it easier for domain experts to choose an appropriate GFO-light category for a specific use case, it is recommended to use situations for modelling static knowledge and processes for modelling dynamic knowledge.

## Time Entity

The time entities defined in GFO-light are points in time (time boundaries) and time intervals/periods (chronoids), which consist of points in time. 

<table>
    <tr><th>Domain class</th><th>GFO-light superclass</th><th>Restriction</th></tr>
    <tr><td>StartOfMatch</td><td>TimeBoundary</td><td><i>temporallyStarts exactly 1 FirstHalf</br>
    													 temporallyStarts exactly 1 Match</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>EndOfFirstHalf</td><td>TimeBoundary</td><td><i>temporallyFinishes exactly 1 FirstHalf</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>StartOfSecondHalf</td><td>TimeBoundary</td><td><i>temporallyStarts exactly 1 SecondHalf</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>EndOfMatch</td><td>TimeBoundary</td><td><i>temporallyFinishes exactly 1 SecondHalf</br>
													   temporallyFinishes exactly 1 Match</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 5a.** *Time classes.*

Concrete individuals have an existence time (time boundary/point in time or chronoid/time interval). There are two ways for assigning a timestamp or a time interval/period to concrete individuals in a domain-specific ontology. The simplest option is to use the data property *dateTimeValue* (or its specific subproperties, e.g., *startedByDateTimeValue*/*finishedByDateTimeValue*) in the data property assertion (e.g., Example 3b a1GoalsEndOfFirstHalf/a1GoalsEndOfMatch/a2RoleImTeam). However, if a timestamp or time interval is to be defined once and reused several times for different individuals, instances of the classes *TimeBoundary* or *Chronoid* must be created, data property assertions based on the aforementioned data properties must be defined for them (Example 5b) and the instances must then be used in the object property assertions of the desired individuals based on the object properties such as *hasTime*, *temporallyStartedBy* or *temporallyFinishedBy* (Example 2b half1, Example 3b winnerLoserRelatorEndOfMatch, Example 4b). If an attributive or a situation is assigned to a process or another situation using the object properties *situationPartOf* or *processPartOf* without defining an existence time, this instance exists in the entire time of the process or situation. In the Example 3b (a2RoleImTeam), only the end time of the player’s role in team is defined. The start time of the role coincides with the start of the match and does not need to be defined.

<table>
    <tr><th>Instance</th><th>Type</th><th>Assertion</th></tr>
    <tr><td>startOfMatch</td><td>StartOfMatch</td><td><i>temporallyStarts half1</br>
														 temporallyStarts matchX</br>
														 dateTimeValue “2020-05-05T21:00:00”^^xsd:dateTime</i></td></tr>
</table>

**Example 5b.** *Time instance.*

GFO-light defined temporal relations between individuals based on [Allen, J. F. (1983). Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals.](https://doi.org/10.1145/182.358434). For this purpose, 13 subproperties of the object property *temporallyRelatedWith* were introduced (*after*, *before*, *during*, *temporallyContains*, *temporallyEqual*, *temporallyFinishedBy*, *temporallyFinishes*, *temporallyMeets*, *temporallyMetBy*, *temporallyOverlappedBy*, *temporallyOverlaps*, *temporallyStartedBy* and *temporallyStarts*). In addition, object properties *hasTemporalPart* (as a shortcut for *temporallyStartedBy or temporallyFinishedBy or temporallyContains*) and *temporalPartOf* (as a shortcut for *temporallyStarts or temporallyFinishes or during*) were defined. If a temporal relation is applied to other concrete individuals as time intervals (i.e., attributive, continuant, process or situation), it is propagated to their existence times. *'StartOfMatch temporallyStarts Match'* (Examples 5a and 5b) means that the time of the match (a chronoid) starts at the defined point of time. Some temporal relations can also be applied to points in time (*before*/*after*, *temporallyEqual*) or a point in time and a time interval (*before*, *temporallyStarts*, *temporallyFinishes*, *during* or their inverse relations). For some temporal relations (object properties), corresponding shortcuts (data properties) are defined for direct use in data property assertions (*afterDateTimeValue*, *beforeDateTimeValue*, *containsDateTimeValue*, *finishedByDateTimeValue*, *startedByDateTimeValue*, *hasTemporalPartDateTimeValue*).
